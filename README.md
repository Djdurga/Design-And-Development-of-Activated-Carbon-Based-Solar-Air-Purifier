# Design-And-Development-of-Activated-Carbon-Based-Solar-Air-Purifier





Air pollution has skyrocketed in the past few years which has increased the respiratory and trigger diverse neurological disorders for kids as well as adults. Such health issues has triggered so many new illness and deficiencies in the human body which has to be taken care appropriately. Damage to neural cells brought on by fine dust, particularly in fetus and newborns, can result in persistent brain damage or adult neurological diseases. The fastest temporary solution is to provide a clean and healthy atmosphere in both the public and private spaces. The proposed system is developed to provide a renewable and reliable solution for the air purifiers by implementing it with a solar based energy source in a low cost and a much greener way.
